    <h1>I Can't Believe There's No Gluten (or Dairy) Brownies!</h1>
      <p>When I gave up gluten and dairy, I thought my baking days were behind me. I wasn't thrilled by the prospect, but I knew that I was committed to my new dietary restrictions. So I resigned myself to a bakeless existence. That is, until I came across the blog post on <a href="https://texanerin.com/the-best-gluten-free-brownies/" title="TexanErin" target="_blank">texanerin.com</a> (another magnificent Erin) that changed my life. A recipe for the ooey-gooiest, fudgy-wudgiest brownies you’ve ever had. And you'd never believe that they’re dairy AND gluten free too! Did I mention that they're totally easy to make too? Seriously, this recipe is a must have in any kitchen, whether you have restrictions or not. Now get ready for some serious decadence and enjoy!</p>
